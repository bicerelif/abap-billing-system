# ABAP Billing System

## Overview
The **ABAP Billing System** is a project billing application built using SAP ABAP. The system is designed to streamline project-related billing processes, including customer and project management, invoice generation, payment reconciliation, and reporting. This project leverages SAP NetWeaver and ABAP Workbench, providing both classical Dynpro screens and optional SAP Fiori integration for a modern user interface.

## Features
- **Customer Management:** Maintain and update customer master data.
- **Project Management:** Link projects to customers with detailed tracking.
- **Invoice Generation:** Automatically generate invoices based on project milestones, hours, or fixed fees.
- **Billing Details:** Manage billing headers and line items for each invoice.
- **Payment Reconciliation:** Track payments and invoice statuses.
- **Reporting:** Generate standard and ad-hoc reports to analyze billing data.

## Project Structure
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
- **Functional and Technical Requirements:** Overview of the business and system requirements.
- **Data Model and Table Design:** Definitions of custom transparent tables (e.g., ZCUSTOMER, ZPROJECT, ZBILLING, ZBILLING_ITEMS) and their relationships.
- **Sample ABAP Code Components:** Examples include:
  - Creation of transparent tables.
  - A simple report to display customer data using ALV.
  - A function module for invoice generation.
- **User Interface Considerations:** Details on Dynpro screen design and optional SAP Fiori integration.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Guidelines for unit testing, integration testing, and deployment strategies using SAP transport requests.

## Prerequisites
- **SAP System:** SAP NetWeaver with ABAP Workbench.
- **Development Tools:** Familiarity with ABAP Objects, Function Modules, ALV Grids, and SAPUI5 (if Fiori is used).
- **Environment:** Access to an SAP system for development, testing, and deployment.

Good Luck :)
